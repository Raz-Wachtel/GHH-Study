    "Relationships between ontogeny and toxicants are vital for toxilogical studies in large fauna. While lengths can be easily documented, aging large elasmobranchs proves to be more of an estimation, and is difficult to do without proper instrumentation, and require vertebrae sections with bomb radiocarbon analysis for validation.\n",
